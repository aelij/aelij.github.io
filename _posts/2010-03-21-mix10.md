I recently attended the Microsoft [MIX10](http://live.visitmix.com/) conference in Las Vegas. I had a nice time, but mostly because of the location; Las Vegas is an interesting place.

  * **The Art, Technology and Science of Reading**   
    by Kevin Larson ([blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/fontblog/))   
    [http://live.visitmix.com/MIX10/Sessions/DS07](http://live.visitmix.com/MIX10/Sessions/DS07 "http://live.visitmix.com/MIX10/Sessions/DS07")   
    This is a fascinating lecture about how we (humans) process words visually. Kevin discusses several studies his group conducted on the subject, with some surprising results.

  * **The Elephant in the Room**   
    by Nishant Kothary ([blog](http://www.rainypixels.com/))   
    [http://live.visitmix.com/MIX10/Sessions/DS13](http://live.visitmix.com/MIX10/Sessions/DS13 "http://live.visitmix.com/MIX10/Sessions/DS13")   
    Nishant effectively demonstrates how we tend to form ill-advised bias towards our peers, and how it applies to the process of software design.
