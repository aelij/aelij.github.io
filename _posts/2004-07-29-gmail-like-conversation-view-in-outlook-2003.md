Well, it's not perfect, but it may be useful to some.

<!--more-->

  * Create a new **search folder** and name it **All Mail**. Don't specify any criteria, and select the folders you want (should be only inbox and sent items folders. You may also want to uncheck the &ldquo;include subfolders&ldquo; option.)
  * Go to **All Mail** and wait for it to finish searching (it may take a while, but it's a one-time thing.)
  * Click the **Arrange By** column and select **Conversation**.

Gmail does this better, as conversations are grouped even when the subject changes, and it only groups a conversation from one person, whereas Outlook may include a mixture in a single group.
