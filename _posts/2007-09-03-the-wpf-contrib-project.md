I've been quiet for a while. Working a lot, and also burning the midnight oil, trying to bring life into this project I call&#8230; the [**WPF Contrib**](http://www.codeplex.com/wpfcontrib/).

<!--more-->

Set up at CodePlex, WPF Contrib is mainly a library of reusable components.&nbsp;My&nbsp;goal is for it to become a true community project. Meanwhile, I invite everyone to review the code, play with the demos and send me feedback! If you want to join, the doors are open. You only need&nbsp;to be a WPF expert ðŸ˜› and have motivation to innovate and share.

I'd also love to hear about what you would like to see in&nbsp;this library. You can use the CodePlex Issue Tracker to request features (or just email me).

The latest&nbsp;addition to the library (and one of my favorites) is the **TaskDialog** control. I've been wanting to write it for some time now. Using it, you can create Task Dialogs in every WPF-supported platform. They help make a&nbsp;very good UX.
