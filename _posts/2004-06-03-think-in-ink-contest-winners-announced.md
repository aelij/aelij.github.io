Microsoft finally [announced](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/jun04/06-02ThinkinInkPR.asp) the winners in the DYCTII contest (I got tired of writing the full name :). But they only mentioned the first two winning categories, so I'm not there :|. Anyway, is there anyone interested in buying my VS.NET Enterprise Developer?
