I finally got around to releasing a new version of [WPF Contrib](https://wpfcontrib.codeplex.com/). So, what's new?

<!--more-->

* Updated to .NET 4.0 (including security transparency attributes).
* Download via NuGet: https://www.nuget.org/packages/AvalonLibrary
* ClickOnce Demo: https://wpfcontrib.codeplex.com/releases/clickOnce/AvalonLibraryTest.application
* `InlineModalDialog` (and `InlineModalDecorator`): Allows creating dialog "windows" as layers inside a WPF Window. This has several advantages to using Windows' dialogs, and it deserves a separate post. See the demo app if you want to learn how to use it right now.
* `TaskDialog` now has `ShowInline` methods that allow showing it using the above method.
* `ListItemMoveBehavior`: Enables dragging and reordering list items. Currently it relies on ObservableCollection's Move() method.
* `ColumnStackPanel` is now a lot easier to use; it auto-calculates the row index.
* `NotifyIcon` now has an explicit `IconVisibility` property (instead of relying on weird values of the `Visibility` property).
* Removed a few controls that are no longer relevant (`GdiTextBlock`, `Bitmap`, Bitmap effect markup extensions).
