I've recently attended Microsoft's [Build](http://buildwindows.com/) conference in San Francisco, and I wanted to share some of my experiences.

<!--more-->

First of all, this was an extremely well organized conference. The Moscone Center in San Francisco is an excellent venue, and everything from registration to sessions went very smoothly.

Both keynotes stressed one major shift for Microsoft: _build faster_. Steve Ballmer talked about a faster release cadence, which was demonstrated by Windows 8.1, Visual Studio 2013 and Windows Azure to name a few. There was also a strong message of _listening_ to customers and _acting_ upon it.

My favorite UI technology was missing from the sessions (but was mentioned in the second keynote).

You can watch all sessions on Channel 9. Here are a few of my favorites:

[Building a UI: What Does it Cost?](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/2-192)
  
My favorite session at Build. DirectX, XAML or HTML? A question I hear all the time. Chris Anderson attempts to answer that question with some neat demos and great insights. You may remember Chris from his mythical [Lap Around Longhorn](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13107) video.

[XAML Performance Fundamentals](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/3-157)
  
Deep dive into performance tuning of XAML Windows Store apps. Includes useful information on how to use WPA.

[Windows Azure Storage: What's Coming, Best Practices, and Internals](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/3-541)
  
A plethora of internal insight into how Azure storage works.

[Building Big: Lessons Learned from Windows Azure Customers](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/4-554)
  
Learn about some important pitfalls when scaling up on Azure.
