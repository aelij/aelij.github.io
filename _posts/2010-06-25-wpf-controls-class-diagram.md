I&rsquo;ve prepared a class diagram for my students of main WPF controls, divided into Decorators, Panels, Content Controls and Items Controls. The diagram was generated using the new [Visual Studio 2010 Visualization and Modeling Tools](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/57b85fsc.aspx) (with a bit of manual cleanup).

I&rsquo;ve also attached an XPS version and the DGML source.
