I have been waiting for while for the Roslyn team to expose the completion and signature help services so I could use them in RoslynPad without having to compile my own version. This was expected to be included in Update 1 but got pushed back.

<!--more-->


So for the time being, I've updated the RoslynPad sample to use the myget Roslyn-nightly feed, which contains the EditorFeatures assemblies, and falling back to Reflection again to use the internal APIs.

In addition, this version has a few neat new features:

  * Code completion and signature help provide an experience much more similar to VS:

  * A new `DumpToPropertyGrid` extension method:
