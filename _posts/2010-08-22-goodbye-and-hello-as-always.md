Today I'm saying goodbye to Sela. I've been a senior consultant at Sela for the past 9 months, and it has been a good experience for me; I'm much more experienced with giving lectures and teaching classes. I've also had a chance to meet and work with some of the leading experts in their fields.

But today is a new day. I'm off to a completely new adventure for me - starting a new company, called [CodeValue](http://codevalue.net/). Along with a group of very talented people, we intend to form a company that would build extremely essential developer tools, and also provide consulting services of the highest quality.

Go on, browse to our new website and check out the team. You'll want to book us for your next project.
