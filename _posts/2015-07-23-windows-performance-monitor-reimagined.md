Windows PerfMon is an invaluable tool, but it's UI remained the same for years, stuck somewhere in the 1990's. This is my attempt at &#8220;reimagining&#8221; it.

Note the edges are still rough (think version 0.1), and it's still missing a lot of features the original tool has. I welcome criticism and ideas; please use GitHub Issues for those.
